Brightmaps Plus for GZDoom

Since GZDoom's brightmaps.pk3 is not fully compatible with Revenant100's Sprite Fixing Project, new brightmaps were needed. This package does not only provide that but also adds many more brightmaps than the original file delivers, e.g. glowing eyes for Doom monsters, weapon pickups or (optional) texture brightmaps. This package builds upon the work of previous brightmaps releases, but many entries have been edited, changed or added for more subtle effects which do not interfere too much with actual gameplay (e.g. monster eyes usually don't glow THAT brightly in the dark any more to avoid revealing monster presence too early). Glowing eyes effect for Soulsphere/Megasphere and slightly sparkling health bonus are all new-additions created by myself.
